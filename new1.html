							<p>In all one's lifetime it is oneself that one spends the most time being with or dealing with. But it is precisely oneself that one has the least understanding of.<br>　　人生在世，和“自己”相处最多，打交道最多，但是往往悟不透“自己”。</p>
							<p>When you are going upwards in life you tend to overestimate yourself. It seems that everything you seek for is within your reach; luck and opportunities will come your way and you are overjoyed that they constitute part of your worth. When you are going downhill you tend to underestimate yourself, mistaking difficulties and adversities for your own incompetence. It's likely that you think it wise for yourself to know our place and stay aloof from worldly wearing a mask of cowardice, behind which the flow of sap in your life will be retarded.<br>　　人生走上坡路时，往往把自己估计过高，似乎一切所求的东西都能垂手可得，甚至把运气和机遇也看做自己身价的一部分而喜不自胜。人在不得意时，又往往把自己估计过低，把困难和不利也看做自己的无能，以至把安分守己，与世无争误认为有自知之明，而实际上往往被怯懦的面具窒息了自己鲜活的生命。</p>
							<p>To get a thorough understanding of oneself is to gain a correct view of oneself and be a sober realist -- aware of both one's strength and shortage. You may look forward hopefully to the future but be sure not to expect too much, for ideals can never be fully realezed. You may be courageous to meet challenges but it should be clear to you where to direct&nbsp; your efforts. That's to way so long as you have a perfect knowledge of yourself there won't be difficulties you can't overcome, nor obstacles you can't surmount.<br>　　悟透自己，就是正确认识自己，也就是说要做一个冷静的现实主义者，既知道自己的优势，也知道自己的不足。我们可以憧憬人生，但期望值不能过高。因为在现实中，理想总是会打折扣的。可以迎接挑战。但是必须清楚自己努力的方向。也就是说，人一旦有了自知之明，也就没有什么克服不了的困难，没有什么过不去的难关。</p>
							<p>To get a thorough understanding of oneself needs selfappreciation. Whether you liken yourself to a towering tree or a blade of grass, whether you think you are a high mountain or a small stone, you represent a state of nature that has its own raison detre. If you earnestly admire yourself you'll have a real sense of self-appreciation, which will give you confidence. As soon as you gain full confidence in yourself you'll be enabled to fight and overcome any adversity.<br>　　要悟透自己就要欣赏自己。无论你是一棵参天大树，还是一棵小草，无论你成为一座巍峨的高山，还是一块小小的石头，都是一种天然，都有自己存在的价值。只要你认真地欣赏自己，你就会拥有一个真正的自我。只有自我欣赏才会有信心，一旦拥有了信心也就拥有了抵御一切逆境的动力。</p>
							<p>To get a thorough understanding of oneself also requires doing oneself a favor when it's needed. In time of anger, do yourself a favor by giving vent to it&nbsp; in a quiet place so that you won't be hurt by its flames; in time of sadness, do yourself a favor by sharing it with your friends so as to change a gloomy mood into a cheerful one; in time of tiredness, do yourself a favor by getting a good sleep or taking some tonic. Show yourself loving concern about your health and daily life. As you are aware, what a person physically has is but a human body that's vulnerable when exposed to the elements. So if you fall ill, it's up to you to take a good care of yourself. Unless you know perfectly well when and how to do yourself a favor, you won't be confident and ready enough to resist the attack of illness.<br>　　要悟透自己，就要心疼自己。在气愤时心疼一下自己，找个僻静处散散心，宣泄宣泄，不要让那些无名之火伤身；忧伤时，要心疼一下自己，找个三五好友，诉说诉说，让感情的阴天变晴；劳累时，你要心疼一下自己，为自己来一番问寒问暖，要明白人所拥有的不过是一个血肉之躯，经不住太多的风力霜剑；有病时，你要心疼一下自己，惟有对自己的心疼，才是战胜疾病的信心和力量。</p>
							<p>To get a thorough understanding of oneself is to get a full control of one's&nbsp; life. Then one will find one's life full of color and flavor.<br>　　悟透了自己，才能把握住自己，你生活才会有滋有味！</p>
